            <div>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Nicholas, and I recently graduated with a Bacehlor of Science
                    degree in Computer Science at Kent State University with a GPA of 3.92. I am
                    currently looking to start my career in Software Engineering. My strongsuits
                    are in C/C#/C++, but I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,
                    MySQL, and more!
                    <br><br>
                    Since before I could read or write, I was fascinated with technology. I also
                    remember having a desire to work with technology from a young age as well. Throughout
                    middle school, I experimented with making my own games, and that developed into a
                    academic interest throughout high school as I took Computer Science courses. At
                    this point, I knew that I wanted to go to college for Computer Science - and I did
                    just that. Kent State University has provided me with the information and ability
                    to realize my dream of a career in software engineering.
