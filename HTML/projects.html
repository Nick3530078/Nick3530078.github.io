                    is a video game that I and five other people created over
                    the course of approximately four months. It was created in Unity and scripted
                    with C#. The premise of the game is for players to earn as many points as possible
                    before defusing the bomb in their car. As each game goes on, the player is able to
                    purchase and utilize various upgrades in a randomly cycling shop in order to stay
                    at the required speed that progressively gets higher over time. Moreover, the random
                    generation offers gameplay variety and progressively gets more difficult over time.
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the gameplay mechanics that I created implementation for are as follows:

                    is a website that I and approximately six other people created
                    over the course of about three months. The website is composed of Python, HTML,
                    CSS, and other technologies in an effort to help people, specifically students,
                    manage their time more efficiently. The service allows users to create, edit, and
                    delete tasks in a calendar. Each task is associated with a specific time as well as
                    a category.
                    <br><br>
                    For the development of this project, I held the position of group president. As such,
                    I not only helped to manage and organize our repository (GitHub), backlog, kanban, and
                    such, but also ensured that each member of the team was supported in their work. Finally,
                    I also aided in the development of the website itself such as writing code for automation
                    and testing.
